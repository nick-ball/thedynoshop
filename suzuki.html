									<blockquote><p style="color: black;">First, we can get some of the technical specifications out of the way for this powerhouse of a sportbike. The 2017 Suzuki GSX-R1000 used an all-new, liquid-cooled, 1000cc in-line 4-cylinder DOHC engine, and Suzuki themselves claimed it to be the most powerful, hardest accelerating, and cleanest running GSX-R engine ever built upon its release. Suzuki was able to achieve a major increase in top end power and suprisingly they did this without sacrificing the low and mid range power by the use of something called the "Suzuki Racing Variable Valve Timing" (SR-VVT) system. As for the fuel injection, of course this machine features ride-by-wire throttle. And of course, coming as no surprise, the engine is attached to a slipper-clutch-enabled six speed transmission and the power is transferred to the rear wheel via chain drive. So now that is out of the way, we can talk more about the fun facts about this particular machine. This Suzuki is actually the owner and operator's personal machine. Why did he choose this manufacturer? Well, Jake has had so many bikes from all of the big names in powersports. For his latest bike, he knew he wanted something that would excel as a performance machine in its stock form. So for that and quite a few other reasons, Jake decided on this machine. Another motivating factor for this choice of bike is the fact that it is the perfect engine and chassis setup to serve as a clean slate for a very strong (and fast) build. Seeing as it will live out its life almost completely in a racetrack setting, there was no holding back in this build. First, the stock plastics, levers, and rearsets came off and were replaced with track oriented parts. Soon after that came the exhaust replacement, and the ECU flash and tune. Again, as you can see from the chart above, there was quite a significant amount power gains - both horsepower and torque gained throughout the rev range. </p>
									<p style="color: black;">Where it gets really interesting though, is when we learned that Jake is working on a behind the scenes addition to the build for this bike. He is tuning each of the cylinders one by one, using highly specific Air/Fuel Ratio data from the Dyno charts and graphs. Of course, as the power output of this bike increases, so does the load or strain on the components. So for that reason, while Jake is working on that aspect of the build, he is forced to keep in mind that it is necessary to upgrade some of the more highly stressed components to cope with the extra power and associated heat generated. Potentially, he could fit lighter, stronger pistons like those that are common on most tuned engines, as stock pistons sometimes are more likely to give out when they are subject to increased heat and higher stresses which are often as a result of a higher operating rpm. Due to that higher rpm achieved from the performance tuning, the connecting rods could also be replaced with high-performance units fabricated from billet steel or even titanium rods. Depending on how far Jake decides to take this all-in build, he may find himself needing to replace or modify the crankshaft as well. There are a lot of different possibilities for this race bike build Jake is working on. If you are curious, or want to follow the journey this bike is taking, please feel free to follow us on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thedynoshop.oh/?hl=en">Instagram</a> or <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/category/Motorsports-Store/The-Dyno-Shop-537307406746916/">Facebook</a>.</p>
									<p style="color:black;">As far as the interactive dyno chart above goes, the stock bike made about one hundred and fifty nine horsepower to the rear wheel. After Jake worked on the bike, and with simply the bolt on modifications, as well as the ECU flash and custom tune, this GSXR 1000 is making a full twenty-nine extra horsepower at peak output. As Jake progresses on his custom build, and decides he needs even more than one hundred and ninety horses to the rear wheel, we expect this bike to hit somewhere near two hundred and ten RWHP or maybe even more. This is certainly one of the few fastest bikes in Powell, Ohio. Too bad it is not street legal.</p></blockquote>
